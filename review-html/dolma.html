    <h1>How To Make Mother's Dolma</h1>
    Dolma is a dish that is both easy and difficult to make. It is easy becuase all we do is mix some meat with some seasonings and rice, and wrap it up into a leaf and let it stew in the pot.
    However, it is difficult because the leaves must be picked in advance during the Summer, washed and picked, so they can be eaten later. The dolma that is bought in jars from the store will not
    acheive the same tenderness or flavor.
