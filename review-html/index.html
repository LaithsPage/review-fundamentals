<!-- Prove you can remember html! Do the following
Make a website that has: 
1) A nav bar with a company logo, a list of links, and a collection of icons that link to socials
2) A main content section that uses flexbox, recreating the layout from TOP landing page project. This time try to make the picture the right resolution and properly aligned with text
3) A sidebar would be cool but the original project we are re-creating did not have a sidebar.
4) Lower section of page should have a footer, an extra zone or two for content, and a contact us form
5) Be sure to follow best practices
6) Maybe it can be a Jeff Buckley Website
